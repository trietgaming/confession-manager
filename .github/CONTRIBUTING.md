# How to contribute

I already love anyone who gives this project attention, it's even more mean to me and users if there's anyone to help develop it.

Please send a [pull request](https://github.com/trietgaming/confession-manager/compare) to this repository with a clear list of what you've done. Always write a clear log message for your commits.

The codes must follow standard TypeScript coding conventions and be easy to read. Please make sure your modifications are in line with the overall code style. We'll review it as soon as possible.

All of the changes will be shown in [confession-manager.app](https://confession-manager.app).

Thank you very much for considering contributing to our project. Your efforts and support are highly appreciated. Happy contributing! ðŸŽ‰
